theme to guide yourself, and having a really visually pleasing daily tracker that encourages
forming habits rather than having monolithic, amorphous goals like "do more personal projects"

"The Spring of Novelty", but those didn't really resonate with me.

I'm starting my second and final rotationin the development program at Deere. I'm continuing with 
the Master's degree, which I *could* finish this year if I load up on classes. I'm in the 
opening act of my career and I want to start it in the best possible way. 

How can I accomplish that? I think first and foremost: do excellent at work. Learn as much as
possible from my coworkers. Put out my best work and and be ambitious in the work I volunteer
for. Network, meet folks and talk about
